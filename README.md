# CircleHead
Circle Head is a simple single player wave based shooting game.
You can control the player with "WASD" and shoot with a left-click.
When you start the game you will see a simple room where you can move.
The game begins with the first wave. Opponents spawn on which you have to shoot. The more levels and waves you play, the harder it gets. Other opponents will appear as well.
